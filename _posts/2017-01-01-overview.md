title: Attending a Jumping Rivers course
---

Thank-you for choosing a [Jumping Rivers](https://jumpingrivers.com) course. 
We hope you enjoy the experience.
If you have any questions before the course, please feel free 
to contact the course organiser before hand. All of our courses
require a laptop. Onsite, we will provide power and wifi. However as you can
imagine the quality of wifi can be variable and is often outside of our control. 
Therefore, please consult the course
pages below to ensure you install the necessary packages before the course. 

Some of the packages are large - so please avoid the urge of leaving installation
until the train journey or the hotel. If in doubt - ask!
