### R and RStudio

Please make sure you are using the latest version of R (version
`r r_ver`) - the final digit is the minor version number. The essentianal numbers 
are the first two. You can check the version of R you are running via
```{r}
R.version
```

Please install the latest version of RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/); 

### Additional packages

This course uses a large number of R packages that should be installed before the course:

```{r eval=FALSE}

drat::addRepo("jr-packages")
install.packages("jrShiny", dependencies = TRUE)
```
