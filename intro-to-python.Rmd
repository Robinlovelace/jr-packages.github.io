Please bring a laptop with __Python 3__ installed, specifically you will be required to have the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python installed as this will come with all the packages necessary for the course.

The installation on operating systems Windows, Mac OS and Linux is supported and straightforward. The graphical installer for Python 3.6 is recommended and remember to read all instructions as it will give the option of adding Python to your path which you must do.
