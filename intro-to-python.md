Please bring a laptop with **Python 3** installed, specifically you will
be required to have the [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python installed as
this will come with all the packages necessary for the course.

The installation on operating systems Windows, Mac OS and Linux is
supported and straightforward. The graphical installer for Python 3.6 is
recommended and remember to read all instructions as it will give the
option of adding Python to your path which you must do.
