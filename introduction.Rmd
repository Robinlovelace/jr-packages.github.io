We realise that we're in a Catch-22 situation here. From our point of view we want you 
to come to the course with R and associated software pre-installed. From your point of view, you're
coming to the course to learn about R. 

As a compromise, please come to the course with R and RStudio already installed (see below). If you can install the additional packages, great, but in general we should be able to sort it out on the day. However,
if you suspect your laptop is going to be awkward, e.g. doesn't contact to wifi, then 
please contact us before the course.

### R and RStudio

Please make sure you are using the latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (version `r current_r_version()`) - the final digit is the minor version number. The essential numbers are the first two. You can check the version of R you are running via

Please install the latest version of RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>);

### Additional packages

This course uses a large number of R packages that should (if possible) be installed before the course. 
After installing R & RStudio, open RStudio and in the __console__ window

![](../graphics/rstudio.png)

Run the following lines of code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("jr-packages")
install.packages("jrIntroduction", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The command

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("jrIntroduction")
```
should run in the console window.
