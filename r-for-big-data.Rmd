### R and RStudio

Please make sure you are using the latest version of R (version
`r r_ver`) - the final digit is the minor version number. The essentianal numbers 
are the first two. You can check the version of R you are running via
```{r}
R.version
```

Please install the preview version of RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

### Compilers (Windows and Macs only)
 
 * For windows users, you will need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
 * For Mac users, you will need xcode

### Additional packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("jr-packages")
install.packages("jrBig", dependencies = TRUE)
sparklyr::spark_install(version="2.1.0")
