```{r echo=FALSE}
source("R/functions.R")
```
`r r_studio_header()`

### Additional packages

It may take a long time to install the course packages and 
so it's very important that this is done before the course. 
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

Please make sure that 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library("rstan")
```
runs. It's also a very good idea to run the the "Eight Schools" example.

Verify that your toolchain works by executing the code below in R and checking that it returns the value 10:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fx <- inline::cxxfunction(signature(x = "integer", y = "numeric" ) , '
	return ScalarReal( INTEGER(x)[0] * REAL(y)[0] ) ;
')
fx(2L, 5 ) # should be 10
```
