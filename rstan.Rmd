```{r echo=FALSE}

```
`r r_studio_header()`

### Additional packages

It may take a long time to install the course packages and 
so it's very important that this is done before the course. 
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

Please make sure that 
```{r echo=FALSE}
library("rstan")
```
runs. It's also a very good idea to run the the "Eight Schools" example.
