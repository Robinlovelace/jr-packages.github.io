### R and RStudio

Please make sure you are using the latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (current version is 3.5.0 - the final digit is the minor version number. The essential numbers are the first two. You can check the version of R you are running via

``` r
R.version.string
```

Please install the latest version of RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>).

### Additional packages

It may take a long time to install the course packages and so it's very important that this is done before the course. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

Please make sure that

``` r
library("rstan")
```

runs. It's also a very good idea to run the the "Eight Schools" example.

Verify that your toolchain works by executing the code below in R and checking that it returns the value 10:

``` r
fx <- inline::cxxfunction(signature(x = "integer", y = "numeric" ) , '
    return ScalarReal( INTEGER(x)[0] * REAL(y)[0] ) ;
')
fx(2L, 5 ) # should be 10
```
