Please bring a laptop with tensorflow v1.4.0 or later installed. For details see:

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

Installation is straightforward under Windows, MacOS and Linux. However it can't be installed on some older laptops (i.e. those with 32 bit CPUs).

Only the simple installation for use with Python and a CPU is needed. You don't need to install GPU support. 

The examples in the course will work with either Python 2 or 3. However, on some operating systems, tensorflow installation requires a recent version of Python. In particular Windows requires Python 3. See the installation instructions for more details.

You should also have access to the following python packages:

  * Keras (we'll be used in the standalone package rather than the library
included within tensorflow)
  * Jupyter
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * sklearn
  * h5py
