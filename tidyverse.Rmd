We realise that we're in a Catch-22 situation here. From our point of view we want you 
to come to the course with R and associated software pre-installed. From your point of view, you're
coming to the course to learn about R. 

On the day, we do have a cloud fall back, but we've found it better if you have the 
software installed on your laptop.

`r r_studio_header()`


### Additional packages

This course uses a large number of R packages that should (if possible) be installed before the course. 
After installing R & RStudio, open RStudio and in the __console__ window

![](../graphics/tidyverse.png)

Run the following lines of code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("jr-packages")
install.packages("jrTidyverse")
```

If everything goes to plan, the command

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("jrTidyverse")
```
should run in the console window without raising any errors or warnings.

Even better is that the package contains a copy of the notes, that can be accessed
via 
```{r, eval  =FALSE}
get_notes()
```
These notes will be updated over the next week or two if we find any typos.

### Pre course questionnaire

To help the instructors prepare for the course, would please complete the 
pre-course [questionnaire](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/q/scotland.html).
It should only take 60 seconds. Thanks
