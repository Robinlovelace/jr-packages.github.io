We realise that we're in a Catch-22 situation here. From our point of view we want you to come to the course with R and associated software pre-installed. From your point of view, you're coming to the course to learn about R.

On the day, we do have a cloud fall back, but we've found it better if you have the software installed on your laptop.

### R and RStudio

Please make sure you are using the latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (current version is 3.4.3 - the final digit is the minor version number. The essential numbers are the first two. You can check the version of R you are running via

``` r
R.version.string
```

Please install the latest version of RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>).

### Additional packages

This course uses a large number of R packages that should (if possible) be installed before the course. After installing R & RStudio, open RStudio and in the **console** window

![](../graphics/tidyverse.png)

Run the following lines of code

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("jr-packages")
install.packages("jrTidyverse")
```

If everything goes to plan, the command

``` r
library("jrTidyverse")
```

should run in the console window without raising any errors or warnings.

Even better is that the package contains a copy of the notes, that can be accessed via

``` r
get_notes()
```

These notes will be updated over the next week or two if we find any typos.

### Pre course questionnaire

To help the instructors prepare for the course, would please complete the pre-course [questionnaire](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/q/scotland.html). It should only take 60 seconds. Thanks
